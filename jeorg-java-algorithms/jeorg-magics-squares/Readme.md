## Introduction

This is an implementation od the magic squares algorithm. This algorithm, allows mathematicians to fully build a magic square very easily and on site using very basic calculations. It only works for odd dimension squares though.

I was inspired in making this when reading through the book [Magic Squares and Cubes by William Andrews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43353307-magic-squares-and-cubes?from_search=true&qid=QrzuPCpoc6&rank=1)
